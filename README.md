# Prime-Number-Generator
Generates prime numbers up to user input using a Sieve of Eratosthenes. Also allows user to observe diagonal striping unique to prime numbers 

I have taken an interest in prime number generation as a side project during my training course. The complexity of generating
larger and larger primes force the coder to become more and more creative in how he or she programs the software to search for these
prime numbers. This has helped me hone my coding skills while allowing me to learn more about the complexity and elegance
of prime numbers.

Currently my code does three things

  1) First the user can choose to have all primes within a range listed. My current laptop becomes rather unhappy 
        when I go above 2,000,000. 
  
  2) Secondly and the more interesting to me is you can have the program list all composite numbers as "0" and 
        all prime numbers as a blue "X" this allows the user to see the diagonal striping the patter that emerges
        when in prime numbers.
        
  3) Third you can print the output onto your desktop. This was for more personal development purposes than functional
        but it works.
        
  This is the extent of my program so far. Next I am looking into generating the prime numbers into an Ulam Spiral.
